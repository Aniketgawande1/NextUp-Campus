# Postman Testing Guide for Node.js Auth & Events API

## Setup

1. First, make sure your server is running with the correct environment variables:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open Postman and create a new Collection named "Events API"

## Testing User Registration

1. Create a new request:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/users/register`
   - Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   - Body (raw JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "username": "testuser",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "password123"
   }
   ```

2. Send the request
3. Expected response (200 OK):
   ```json
   {
     "message": "User registered successfully",
     "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
     "user": {
       "id": "...",
       "username": "testuser",
       "email": "test@example.com"
     }
   }
   ```
4. Save this request in your collection

## Testing User Login

   ```json
   {
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "password123"

2. Send the request
3. Expected response (200 OK):
   ```json
   {

     "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
     "user": {
       "id": "...",
       "username": "testuser",
       "email": "test@example.com"
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Important**: Copy the token from the response - you'll need it for authorized requests

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 401 Unauthorized Error
- Make sure your token is valid and correctly formatted in the Authorization header
- Format should be exactly: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- Check that the JWT_SECRET in your .env matches what was used to generate the token

### 404 Not Found Error for Single Event
- Verify that the event ID in the URL is correct
- Check if MongoDB is running and the event exists in the database

### 400 Bad Request
- Check the format of your request body
- Ensure all required fields are provided
- Verify email format for registration/login

### 500 Server Error
- Check your server console for detailed error messages
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Ensure environment variables are correctly set
